How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User needs are interpreted into a program by taking each bit of functionality and breaking it down into the very basics. 
  User stories help with this by giving small little bits of functionality that can be turned into small deliverables
  that can be combined to create the end product. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I currently approach developing programs by taking it on as one big deliverable. This is by far, not the best approach
  as I have learned throughout this course. In the future, I would like to incorporate agile processes such as sprints
  and a backlog/prioritization into my development work. 
  
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member means adhering to best practice and 
  offering up best contributions and attention to the team/product.
